# Custom-Characters
This is intended to be a work-in-progress (Especially since I'm totally new to the programming/hacking/modding community) on a grossly modified Pathfinder/D&amp;D 3.X Hero Lab module. The express purpose is to make virtually every aspect of the character creation process 'point buy'. I will also be trying to include more Base Ability Scores to include things such as Luck, Beauty, and all other Base Ability Scores I can find as being possibly usable, but toggleable. 

Every other aspect of a character (including increasing Base Attack Bonus, Ability Scores, Saves, Magic, Psionics, Skill Points, HP, Magic Points, Power Points, Ki Points, Grit Points, Panache Points, Astral Armor Customization Points, "Special" Abilities, and Feats) are all "purchased" with Experience, and a character's "level" is determined by the highest of any of those.

Each aspect usually 'costs' a different amount, based on it's 'level' but a higher level character can still 'purchase' any of the above at it's lowest level. For example, a character that's 7th level wants to purchase it's 2nd rank of Spellcraft. The first costs 25 experience (purchased at 1st level) and the second (now that the character is level 7) will still cost 50 experience (25 experience X 'level' 2 = a cost of 50 experience.

There should also be a togalable time and monitary requirement for 'learning' or 'improving' anything. 
I have all the base information and more, but what I need help with right now is creating a 'shell' that works and that's easily manipulatable so I can add to any aspect: Base Ability Types, Skills and their associated ability score modifiers, Feats, Special Abilities, Spells, Spell Points, Power Points, Spells Per Day, Etc.
