# Custom-Characters
This is intended to be a work-in-progress (Especially since I'm totally new to the programming/hacking/modding community) on a grossly modified Pathfinder/D&amp;D 3.X Hero Lab module. The express purpose is to make virtually every aspect of the character creation process 'point buy'. I will also be trying to include more Base Ability Scores to include things such as Luck, Beauty, and all other Base Ability Scores I can find as being possibly usable, but toggleable. 

The following is the rough explenation and costs of everything, as well as the new mechanics:

An amount of time and money must be spent to learn anything, as well as someone to teach them. (PC's can teach other PC's how anything they already know ( and charge whatever they wish, but the time required to learn anything is the same.) An amount of time equal to 1 month per level for each rank of skill, ability score increase, learning a Feat, for every 6 HP, 6 Spell Points, etc. The gold cost is equal to the experience cost. 
	Magic takes a minimum of 5 months to learn, and costs a minimum of 500 gp at a school. If the character is apprenticed to a Master, this cost may be reduced. This is similar to the Apprentice feat.
	More than 1 thing may be learned at the same time as long as the character has a high enough Intelligence Modifier. A number of feats, ranks in skills, 6 HP/SP may be earned at the same time equal to the character's Intelligence Modifier, to a minimum of 1 feat, 1 rank in 1 skill, 6 HP or SP, etc., while a character with a 20 Intelligence has a modifier of +5, so can learn 5 feats at once, or 1 rank in 5 Skills, up to 30 HP or SP, or any combination thereof. Learning more things at once takes time, and a cumulative additional ½ month must be added onto the time it takes to learn anything. Conversely, a character with a high Intelligence can subtract 1 week for every point of modifier to learn something if they are only learning 1 thing at a time, to a minimum of 1 week. 
	If a character has an Intelligence with a negative modifier, they can only learn 1 thing at a time, and the time it takes is increased cumulatively by ½ for every point of negative modifier.
	Pets, animal companions and familiars may be taught tricks, skills, and feats, though that is very limited, based on the creatures Intelligence. Pets/animals with an Intelligence of 3 or less may only be taught a number of tricks/feats and skill points in a number of skills equal to their HD. Animal companions and Familiars with an Intelligence higher than 3 may be taught as a PC.

Levels: Levels are determined by the highest of all the character's Skill rank, Save, Spell Point (levels), Hit Point total (levels), and/or Base Attack Bonus. For example, character can be “level 3” by having any or all of the following:  BAB of +3, up to 36 (+ 3 x Con mod) Hit Points, any Skill(s) have 3 ranks, any Base Save is +3, any Ability Score is 27 (+/- racial modifiers excluding permanent inherent bonuses such as from potions or tomes/manuals for example). 
	For example: To be 10th level, a character must have any of the following: BAB +10, up to 120 (+ 10 x Con mod) Hit Points, any Skill(s) with 10 ranks, +7 to any Base Saves, any Ability Score of 34 (+/- racial modifiers, but excluding permanent inherent bonuses such as from potions or tomes/manuals for example).
	A character need not have all of this to gain a level. They may choose to focus on Base Attack Bonus if they choose, and be 10th level, but not have any Skills, Saves, Hit Points or maxed Ability Scores. If a character chooses to do something like this (even though it's not recommended) they may still buy Save Bonuses, Skill ranks, and Hit Points at the price for the level they are currently at. 
	Next example: A character chooses to have a +7 BAB, and 91 HP (84 from purchasing HP by level, and +7 from bonus hit points by level), but no bonuses on Saves, or any Skill ranks. This character may purchase ranks for each skill as if it were still level 1, because that skill is indeed level 1, and may be purchased for 25 experience. The same is true for each bonus point of saving throw.
	Last Example: A character, could, in theory, take every first level Special ability (~115 as of 1/23/17), Magic, Psionics, put a rank in every skill from the extended Skill list (~131 skills including the Skill based BAB instead of the standard BAB. This total does not include every possible Craft, Knowledge (except the standard Knowledge skills), Performance or Profession, but includes ~5 of each for calculations in this example.), improve all their Ability Scores to racial maximum (assuming it takes ~60 points total to increase the characters ability scores to racial maximum), Increase all their Saving Throws to +2, maximize their HP, SP, and PP, purchase 10 feats (just to give a round number for feats as there isn't a limit to the number of feats that may be purchased at 1st level other than the number of that a 1st level character can meet the prerequisite for), and increase their BAB (using the skill version that costs more overall though), purchase Ki, Grit and Panache for roughly 34,275 experience and still be considered a 1st level character.

Ability Scores: Each character starts off with 90 ability points to distribute as they please, as long as no score is lower than 3 (after racial ability modifiers) and no higher than 18 (before ability modifiers).
	Each Ability Score may be increased after the initial distribution, up to the racial soft maximum of 25 (+/- racial modifiers) for 150 experience per point. Thus, if a player wished, their character could, at first level (assuming they're human or some race without racial ability modifiers) could achieve 25 in each ability score.
	Those wishing to increase their ability scores beyond this point must pay spend more experience. The first point beyond the racial soft maximum costing 300, the second 600, the third 900, etc.
	Note: You must keep track of permanent inherent bonuses separately. For example, if a character drink a potion or reads a tome/manual that permanently increases an ability score, then you must keep track of those bonuses separately as they do not affect your 'ability score level'.
	For example: Drax is a human, that's focusing on Dexterity. He is still level 1, and already increased his Dexterity to 25. If Drax wants to increase his Dexterity to 26, he must pay 300 experience, and that would make him level 2 if he isn't already, just as raising a skill to rank 2 would increase his level. Every point of Dexterity after 25 would increase his level 1 but may be purchased at the appropriate level without further increasing it. So if Drax was already level 2, and purchased a point to increase his Dexterity to 26, it would not increase his level to 3, but increasing it to 27 would.

Hit points: A character can gain up to 12 hit points per level (with a maximum of 12 base HP at 1st level, regardless of what the character starts off with). This is attained by expending 25 experience for each hit point to be gained per level. For example, to purchase hit points for first level would cost 25 experience per hit point. The cost of HP once a character becomes second level would cost 50 experience each, and at 3rd level, 75 experience each, etc. Bonus hit points from Constitution are added when they attain a new overall level and need not be purchased.
	Side Note: It should be noted, that with this system, that a character doesn't take a penalty to HP for having a negative modifier, they just don't receive any as a bonus each level.
	For example: Drax starts with 1 hp (+ any Constitution Modifier) for being alive, and over the course of growing up, learns to shrug off a bit of physical harm (gained HP). Through his experiences before his adventuring career, he's gained 5 HP, for a total of 6 his Constitution Modifier (His Constitution Modifier for this exercise will be 10, for ease of calculations). Now Drax goes on an adventure, and survives, coming back with 400 experience. He wants to become even tougher, so spends time with the local militia learning how to become tougher, and learn how to use weapons. Drax decides to purchase 6 more HP, giving him a total of 12. If he purchases 7 HP, giving him a total of 13, he would be a 2nd level character and thus receive 2 times his Constitution Modifier in HP, but would also gain less in experience.

Skill Ranks: Each Skill Rank costs 25 experience per rank. You are limited to a number of ranks in any individual skill, equal to your level. 
	Side Note: At purchasing the first rank in any skill, it is considered a class skill and an automatic +3 bonus is added (either under Class Skill, or Misc. if your form does not have a specific space for a Class Skill bonus).
	You may acquire other bonuses through Feats and special effects or training. As some abilities require specific 'class' levels, all “Class(es)” are now under the Skill: Profession (Class). 
	For example: Drax is level 1, and has purchased 1 rank in every skill, and decides to purchase rank number 2 in Acrobatics. This second rank will cost 50 experience, and increases Draxes level to 2 (if he isn't already).

Feats: A character may purchase any feat for 150 experience points per level required to attain the feat, as long as they meet all requirements to gain it besides the experience cost.
	Note: A character may purchase any and all feats, as long as they meet the prerequisites to gaining the feat. This potentially means a 1st level character could, in theory, have virtually any number of feats.

Class Abilities and Special Qualities: Class abilities and Special Qualities may be purchased at the lowest level possible that the ability becomes available for any class for the same experience cost as a Feat.

Saves: There are 3 Saves a character have, known as: Fortitude, Reflex and Will. Up to +2 may be purchased to each Save at first level, each +1 purchased separately, and +1 may be purchased at every even level thereafter.
	For example: A character may purchase +2 Fortitude (2 x 150 = 300 Exp.) at level 1, and may purchase another +1 Fortitude at level 2, 4, 6, etc. Each point costing the appropriate amount for that level (IE: 300 at 2nd level, 600 at 4th level, etc.

Base Attack Bonus: BAB costs 300 experience per level to increase in the same manner as Skills.

Magic: Magic has an initial cost of 500 experience to learn to use and manipulate. After this one time cost has been paid, abilities may be learned as long as their requirements are met. Purchasing 1 point in any school of magic allows characters to learn and use 0-level spells of that school. 0-level spells are special in that they do not require spell points, and can be cast virtually at will, using the spells description. Character must learn each spell independently, and copy them down by some means (generally in the same way as wizards, in spellbook or spellcrystal) but after doing so they may cast any spell they know virtually at will, using the spells description, and as long as you have the spell points to be able to cast it.
	Note: To cast any spell, the caster must have a casting ability score equal to 10 + the spells level, and a number of ranks in the spells school(s) equal to twice the level of spell. 0 level spells must have a rank of 1 in any school to be cast with the exception of General/Universal spells, that can be learned and  cast using only Spellcraft as long as the caster has enough Spell Points to cast an individual spell.

Psionics: The exact same rules apply to learning and improving psionics as Magic. Individual psionic powers must be learned the standard way, with no limit on the number of powers that may be known. 

Spell Points: Unlike Hit Points, a character must have Skill ranks in any of the schools of magic (for example Spellcraft: Abjuration, Spellcraft: Conjuration, Spellcraft: Divination, Spellcraft: Enchantment, Spellcraft: Evocation, Spellcraft: Illusion, Spellcraft: Necromancy, Spellcraft: Transmutation) to gain Spell Points, and any character wanting to endeavor into magic to cast spells beyond 0-level must have Spell Points.  Like Hit Points, they are also limited by the number of points a character may purchase at each level. A character may only purchase up to 12 spell points per level, plus they can automatically have a bonus to their spell points if their highest mental mod allows it (see table below). A character also receives 1 bonus Spell point for each rank in a school of magic they posses. 
	For example: Drax spends all his experience on spell points, and only increasing Spellcraft (Abjuration). By level 20, he has 240 spell points from purchasing spell points, plus 20 points for having 20 ranks in Spellcraft (Abjuration), plus his high mental score of 20 a bonus for 50 free spell points for a total of 310 spell points. 
	Furthering the above example, if Drax has 20 ranks in all 7 spell schools, then he has 140 spell points, plus the 240 spell points he purchased maxing out the number of spell points he can have (excluding the possible purchase of feats) and if he has a 20 for his casting score, being 20th level, gains 50 free bonus spell points for a total of 430 spell points.
	Spell Points do not permit access to spells. Each school of spell is a Skill that a character may put ranks into just like any other skill. The number of ranks in the school(s) will determine the maximum level of spell castable by the character (of any given school). Divide the number of ranks in half to determine the level of spells of a particular school that a character may cast. 
	For example: If Drax only has ranks in only Abjuration, he can't learn or cast spells that also require Evocation.
	It should be further noted that the individual Spellcraft (School) receives no “class” bonuses as other skills do, but hat Spellcraft does. Feats and abilities still affect Schools as normal.

Psionic Points: Power Points may be purchased exactly like spell points, with the same cost, and bonus points for high mental abilities. The associated skills are Psicraft, with the sub disciplines being Psicraft: Clairsentience, Psicraft: Metacreativity, Psicraft: Psychokinesis, Psicraft: Psychometabolism, Psicraft: Psychoportation, Psicraft: Telepathy. Psionic Points and Magic Points are separate and do not come from the same source.

Astral Armor Customization Points: After purchasing Psionics, and Form Astral Armor, up to 3 Customization Points may be purchased at every character level. These points cost 75 experience each.

Ki Points: A character can learn to harness their Ki, and gain ki points. Learning to master ones Ki requires an initial experience expenditure of 150 experience. A character starts off with 3 + their Wisdom Modifier Ki Points, and may purchase 3 Ki points per level at a cost of 75 experience each per level. A character receives bonus Ki points based off their Wisdom score as compared to the Bonus Spell Point chart.

Panache Points: More than just a lightly armored warrior, a swashbuckler is a daring combatant. She fights with panache: a fluctuating measure of a swashbuckler's ability to perform amazing actions in combat. At the start of each day, a swashbuckler can gain a number of panache points equal to 3 x her Charisma modifier (minimum 1), to her maximum.
	Learning Panache has an initial cost of 150 experience, and requiring specialized training. Each extra point added to a character's maximum is to be purchased separately, costing 75 experience each. A maximum number of points may be purchased equal to 3 times the character's level (on top of the initial number gained from the character's Charisma Modifier as their base).  A swashbuckler spends panache to accomplish deeds, and regains panache in the following ways.
	Critical Hit with a Light or One-Handed Slashing &/or Piercing Melee Weapon: Each time the swashbuckler confirms a critical hit with a light or one-handed slashing &/or piercing melee weapon, she regains 1 panache point. Confirming a critical hit on a helpless or unaware creature or a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the swashbuckler's character level does restore panache.
	Killing Blow with a Light or One-Handed Slashing &/or Piercing Melee Weapon: When the swashbuckler reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points with a light or one-handed slashing &/or piercing melee weapon attack while in combat, she regains 1 panache point. Destroying an unattended object, reducing a helpless or unaware creature to 0 or fewer hit points, or reducing a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the swashbuckler's character level to 0 or fewer hit points does restore any panache.

Grit Points: A gunslinger makes her mark upon the world with daring deeds. Some gunslingers claim they belong to a mystical way of the gun, but it’s more likely that the volatile nature of firearms simply prunes the unlucky and careless from their ranks. Whatever the reason, all gunslingers have grit. In game terms, grit is a fluctuating measure of a gunslinger’s ability to perform amazing actions in combat. At the start of each day, a gunslinger gains a number of grit points equal to 3 x her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Her grit goes up or down throughout the day. 
	Learning Grit has an initial cost of 150 experience, and requiring specialized training. Each extra point added to a character's maximum is to be purchased separately, costing 75 experience each. A maximum number of points may be purchased equal to 3 times the character's level (on top of the initial number gained from the character's Wisdom Modifier as their base). A gunslinger spends grit to accomplish deeds, and regains grit in the following ways.
	Critical Hit with a Firearm: Each time the gunslinger confirms a critical hit with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Confirming a critical hit on a helpless or unaware creature or on a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger’s character level does not restore grit.
	Killing Blow with a Firearm: When the gunslinger reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Destroying an unattended object, reducing a helpless or unaware creature to 0 or fewer hit points, or reducing a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger’s character level to 0 or fewer hit points does not restore any grit.
